## 🎯 Why RootPine?

I created RootPine because existing tools weren’t keeping up. Even when they passed all checks, banking apps could still detect root access.RootPine tackles this issue by adding additonal checks and methods along with existing methods to detect root.

- **Simple and lightweight**  
- **Modern, user-friendly UI**  
- **Dark and light theme support**
